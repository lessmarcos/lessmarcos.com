### About this site

This site is mostly about software and tech, but here you may also
find writings under many subjects. If there is anything that may
distinguish this @{site||blog}@ from others is that it is what I call a 
*parallel @{site||blog}@*. This means that for every page P hosted on
this site, there exists multiple versions of P and all of them co-exist
under the same URL of P.

Take this page as an example: refresh the page and you would 
@{probably||}@ get a different version of it; a version that conveys the 
same meaning (most of the time) but looks slightly different.
You can find out more about this idea in the post 
[Parallel Blogs](https://www.lessmarcos.com/posts/2020/08/parallel-blogs/).

This site is built with [belbo](https://github.com/lessmarcos/belbo).

### About me

I'm Marcos. I work as a @{software engineer||programmer||developer}@ in Germany.
@{||And probably that's pretty much all you need to know.}@
