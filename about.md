### About this site

This site is mostly about software, but here you may also find writings 
under many subjects. If there is anything that may
distinguish this @{site||blog}@ from others is that it is what I call a 
*parallel @{site||blog}@*. This means that for every page P of this site, 
there exists multiple versions of P and all of them co-exist
under the same URL of P.
Take this page as an example: refresh the page and you may 
@{probably||}@ get a different version of it; a version that conveys the 
same meaning (most of the time) but looks slightly different.
You can find out more about this idea in the post 
[Parallel Blogs](https://www.lessmarcos.com/posts/2020/08/parallel-blogs/).
@{It's a silly idea,||It's a tremendous idea,}@ I know.

This site is built with [belbo](https://github.com/lessmarcos/belbo).

### About me

My name is Enrique Marcos. I currently live in the <em>land east of the Rhine</em>, 
previously lived in the <em>land of rabbits</em>, and, long time ago, I lived in the 
<em>lands of the then local chief of the southernmost part of the New World</em>.

I started to work as a @{software engineer||programmer||developer}@ in 2012, and, to be honest, 
I can't really complain since then.
 
I usually work on personal projects from time to time, just for sports. These usually
involve coding, but sometimes they have nothing to do with computers. The former are the
ones I almost never finish; the latter are the ones I don't brag about. Nevertheless,
I enjoy very much the act of creating something (anything) from scratch (but at work I
don't practice this as much as I would like).

Current project code name: FJ.<br>
Previous project name: belbo.
