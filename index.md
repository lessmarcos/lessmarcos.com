<a href="/"><h1>Hi</h1></a>

I'm Marcos. I live with my wife in Germany where I work as a computer programmer. 
I'm not a dad and I don't have pets, but if I ever have a dog I will
call it  Hbf (pronounced *hawpt&middot;baan&middot;hof*).

I'm a big fan of starting new things and rarely finishing them. The good thing is: I get to learn
some @{(useless?)||}@ stuff. The not so good thing is: I don't get to brag about it.
Anyway, in an alternate universe I'm sure I've worked on something that revolutionized
the IT world. Meanwhile in this universe, you can check what I'm doing right <a href="/now/">now</a>,
read some <a href="/sessions/">stuff</a> I have written in the past, or find out 
more <a href="/about/">about me and this site</a>.

`lessmarcos.com` is just a place where I archive my stuff, so if it's prose 
you may find grammar mistakes; if it's code you'll definitely find bugs!
