<a href="/"><h1>Hi</h1></a>

I'm Marcos. I used to like drawing, and I used to write a lot. Nowadays I prefer reading.
I live with my wife in Germany. I work as a programmer (and I like it).

I'm a big fan of starting new things and rarely finishing them. The good thing is: I get to learn
some (useless?) stuff. The not so good thing is: I don't get to brag about it.
Anyway, in an alternate universe I'm sure I've worked on something that revolutionized
the IT world. Meanwhile, in this universe, you can check what I'm doing right <a href="/now/">now</a>,
read some more <a href="/sessions/">structured stuff</a>, or find out more <a href="/about/">about me and
this site</a>.

`lessmarcos.com` is a place where I archive my stuff raw & unedited, so if it's prose 
you may find grammar mistakes; if it's code you'll definitely find bugs!
