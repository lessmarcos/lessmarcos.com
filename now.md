Things I'm doing at the moment.

- I'm working (sparingly) on a project I call GJ
- I'm redesigning this website
- I'm trying to fix an additional iPOD shuffle I bought (as a backup for my main one). Somehow
because it was all the time sitting there without me using it, the battery has drained and it doesn't 
start anymore
- I'm watching Narcos

I'm reading:

- Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook by  Evi Nemeth et al.
- Utopia by Thomas More
- TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1: The Protocols by Kevin R. Fall, W. Richard Stevens
- The Prague Cemetery by Umberto Eco
- Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe
