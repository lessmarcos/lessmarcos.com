<div class="post-date">06 Jun 2021</div>
Once again I have changed the style of the website. I had to update [belbo] to support content
in multiple directories (see [`817bd5b`](https://github.com/lessmarcos/belbo/commit/817bd5b170e5ebeb93e55e0cae2a2b444d6fff96)),
but it turned out I actually didn't need the feature.
