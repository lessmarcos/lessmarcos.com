### 1. The books I like but I don't know yet

There is a place where book recommendations are not based on
genres, on ratings, on connections, on whether they were enjoyed
by the same people or not. Communities are not needed to provide
discoverability of books you probably would like to read@{.|| (although they
exist nonetheless).}@

In such a place, recommendations of books are based on their content. 
In this place I can discover @{unknown||}@ books in which the main character
shares traits with @{Jacopo Belbo||Funes el memorioso}@; I get to know
books in which philosophical topics are discussed the way Sartre used to do.
*Systems* recommend me books in which their characters discuss questions
of god's existence and the immortality of the soul the way it's done in
The Brothers Karamazov.

There is not only one *system* that offers recommendations. There are
multiple online services that do the same. All of this is possible because
all books are open. Anyone can download any book in raw format (a plain TXT file).

### 2. Music

Some systems do an amazing job with books while others do an amazing job
recommending music (because music, in this place, is open as well). You want
to listen to a song that gives you the same vibe as @{Good Vibrations||
Dancing in the Dark}@ or @{A Hard Days Night||2000 Light Years from Home}@? Easy. Hard-coded genres are a thing of the past. In this place
genres are based on wavelength and pitch.

### 3. Everything

In this place, the content of any digital resource can be downloaded 
@{||(and hence analyzed)}@ for free. Services exist that offer comparisons, 
recommendations and discoverability based on different filters. This is only 
possible because @{almost any|| every}@ digital resource in this place is open.

### 4. Really?

It actually makes sense if you think about it, at least to some extent. You like
a book not because of its author or the genre or the year of its publication. You
like a book because of its content, because of how it's written. You want to 
discover books that are written in the same way; you may want to discover books
that are written in a diametrically opposite way. None of this is possible if all
you got is just book metadata.
